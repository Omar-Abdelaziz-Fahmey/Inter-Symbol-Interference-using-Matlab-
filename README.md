# Inter-Symbol-Interference-using-Matlab-
in any communication system The square transmitted signal is no longer a square signal coming out of the channel to receiver . In fact, the shape of the square signal out of the channel has “leaked” outside of the duration 𝑇 = 2/𝐵 that was intended at the beginning. If there are multiple square signals after each other (one square signal for each bit), these leaked parts will interfere with the signals of other bits. This phenomenon is called Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). In this project we deal with this problem in idea channel and multipath channel , calculating BER in each transmitted packet

you can understand the required in Digital communication lab pdf file 
First part is introduced in final matlab file we use generate square pulse file as a function in a project 
second part in multipath file 
it's a final project for 4th year in digital communication course
